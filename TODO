Replace foreach with mclapply

Start testing with iris data set and figure out the next step
Determine how to pass arguments from ... to multiple classifiers in query_by_committee


Figure out how to work with vignette (i.e. more generally, knitr or Sweave) from emacs and ESS on Linux


Iris Data Set
	Classifiers
		Consider LDA, QDA, SVM (with RBF), and RF
			Do this with 'caret'
	Oracle Setup
		The oracle is infallible.
		Query 1 and 5 observations each time until done.
	Active Learning Methods
		Random query
		Uncertainty Sampling with Iris Data Set
			Use the 3 uncertainty sampling methods
		Query by Bagging
			Try B = 10, 50, and 100
		(Optional) Query by Committee


Move the vignette to ./inst/doc
	After adding the initial simulation code to the vignette
Build the package vignette through R.
	Link: http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/Sweave-Rnews-2003-2.pdf


After the query_by_committee setup is determined, update its @examples to reflect the changes.

When returning results from the active learning functions, consider the following:
	Rather than returning the 'obs_uncertainty' or something just as obscure,
	consider naming this the same as the uncertainty or disagreement measure.
	Example: If we are considering 'entropy' in uncert_sampling(), then return
	'entropy' as a list component instead of 'obs_uncertainty'

Remove ~/projects/active-learning after double-checking that I have the report backed up in this package's /inst/
