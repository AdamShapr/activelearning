* Implement a function that checks if the 'caret' options are specified correctly.
This function should essentially be a copy-paste of the first few error-checking lines
in uncert_sampling. This code will be used in all activelearning methods that are built
on top of caret. Because I have several active learning methods planned, it is important
to have only one copy of this code.
* Update activelearning documentation
* Update activelearning_sim documentation so that the 'Details' is more independent of the first paragraph.
* Implement the usage of 'caret' in query_by_committee
* Implement an example for query_by_committee
* Update documentation in query_by_committee to describe the usage of 'caret'
* After a few tests, add NEWS with what's been added, upgrade version to 0.1 and merge with main branch.
