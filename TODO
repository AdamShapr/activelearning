Throw an error if the "uncertainty" measure is incorrect in uncert_sampling().
 Write a unit test to catch this.
Throw an error if the "disagreement" measure is incorrect in query_by_bagging().
 Write a unit test to catch this.
The R package needs a spiffy new name.
When returning results from the active learning functions, consider the following:
	Rather than returning the 'obs_uncertainty' or something just as obscure,
	consider naming this the same as the uncertainty or disagreement measure.
	Example: If we are considering 'entropy' in uncert_sampling(), then return
	'entropy' as a list component instead of 'obs_uncertainty'
