Examine active learning performance for some of the mlbench data sets.
If we replace LDA with another classifier, how do things perform?
	SVM, logistic regression, random forests, MDEB?

May need to write a report about active learning, the methods that we are considering, why we are considering them, and where we see room for improvement.
	Maximize loss * marginal (over all unlabeled)
	Noisy oracles
		Multiple oracles disagree
		Oracle's performance decays
