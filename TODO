Throw an error if the "uncertainty" measure is incorrect in uncert_sampling().
 Write a unit test to catch this.

In uncert_sampling():
	The line with "which(order(obs_uncertainty, decreasing = T) <= num_query)" does not preserve the rank order.
	Need to change this, so that the first index corresponds to the element with the largest uncertainty.
