Description: Active learning is a machine learning paradigm
    for optimally choosing unlabeled observations in a
    training data set to query for their true labels. The
    framework is particularly useful when there are very
    few labeled observations relative to a large number of
    unlabeled observations, and the user seeks to determine
    as few true labels as possible to achieve highly
    accurate classifiers.  This package is a collection of
    various active learning methods from the literature to
    optimally query observations with respect to a variety
    of objective functions. Some active learning methods
    require posterior probability estimates of the
    unlabeled observations from a single classifier or a
    committee of classifiers; this package allows the user
    to specify custom classifiers. An excellent literature
    survey has been provided by Dr. Burr Settles.
